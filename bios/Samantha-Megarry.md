Originally from Burlington, Ontario, Samantha is a graduate of Concordia University's Theatre Performance program (BFA with distinction). Select credits include Lady Macduff/Angus in Macbeth (Repercussion Theatre), Mae in The Wild Party (In Your Face Entertainment), Rachel in Ludlow Fair (Concordia University SIPA Festival), and Antigone in Peleus & Thetis (Concordia University). After four years in Montreal with this team, everything is truly coming full-circle on Hopegrown's hometown tour. Thank you to my wonderful family and friends, the Hopegrown team, and everyone who will see the show this summer!
