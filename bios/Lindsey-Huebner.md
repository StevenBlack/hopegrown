Lindsey grew up in Ottawa and is very excited to make her professional debut with this talented bunch of artists and friends. Lindsey received a BFA (with distinction) in theatre performance from Concordia University. Select Concordia credits include Ludlow Fair, The Last Days of Judas Iscariot, Peleus and Thetis and Peer Gynt. Next year, Lindsey is hopping across the pond to complete her MA Acting at the Brisol Old Vic Theatre School. Infinite thank you's to my dear family and supportive friends, without whom this would have been impossible.
