Originally from Vancouver, Sonya moved to Montreal to pursue a career in the theatre. Well, an education in theatre at any rate. Currently entering her final year in Concordia University’s Design for Theatre program, she has had the opportunity to work in many facets of production on many great projects over the last few years. Projects include, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Repercussion Theatre; Head à Tête, Geordie Productions; Love U Lovecraft, The Other Theatre; The Seventh Seal, and Theatre_Business, Concordia University. Around Miss Julie is no exception; the wonderful team involved with Hopegrown Productions has made this project an exhilarating experience. Wishing everyone the best of luck as the summer tour continues.
