				<p><strong>Miriam Cummings</strong><br>Co-Founder and Actor for <em class="lotus">LOTUS</em><br>For Hopegrown: Julie in <em>Around Miss Julie</em> 2013</p>
				<p>Miriam was born and raised in London, Ontario. In 2013, she graduated with a BFA in theatre performance from Concordia University. Recent theatre credits include Glorious Lavoone in <em>Emma Lou and the Big Ragout</em> (In Your Face Entertainment) and Bianca in <em>Taming of the Shrew</em> (Repercussion Theatre). Offstage, you can find Miriam writing snail mail, experimenting with a new recipe or dreaming about her next travel destination. Hopegrown's first year of existence was amazing in so many ways. Endless gratitude and joy to the people who made our adventure possible. Julie will always hold a special place in Miriam's heart for at her best, Julie is naive, hopeful,
				self-important and yes, clueless when it comes to directing a play. Cheers to delving into a new world of imperfect characters with exceptional
				teammates. Cheers to <em class="lotus">LOTUS</em>!.</p>

				<p><strong>Samantha Megarry</strong><br>Co-Founder and Actor for <em class="lotus">LOTUS</em><br>For Hopegrown: Ilona in <em>Around Miss Julie</em> 2013</p>
				<p>Originally from Burlington, Ontario, Samantha holds a BFA in Theatre Performance from Concordia University. Select credits include Mae in <em>The Wild Party</em> (In Your Face Entertainment), Rachel in <em>Ludlow Fair</em> (Concordia University), Lady Macduff/Angus in <em>Macbeth</em> (Repercussion Theatre), and of course Ilona in <em>Around Miss Julie</em> (Hopegrown Productions). When not acting, Samantha can be found at hot yoga, running through NDG, or working at the best Irish pub in town. Hopegrown's inaugural season was truly a dream come true. It is with great pride (and overwhelming excitement) that we bring <em class="lotus">LOTUS</em> to the stage this summer. Thank you to my wonderful family, past and present members of the Hopegrown team, and everyone who will see the show this summer! </p>

				<p><strong>Lindsey Huebner</strong><br>Co-Founder<br>For Hopegrown: Donna in <em>Around Miss Julie</em> 2013</p>

Recent credits include <em>The Bucket</em>, <em>Ludlow Fair</em>, <em>The Last Days of Judas Iscariot</em>, <em>Peer Gynt</em>, and of course, Hopegrown's inaugural production <em>Around Miss Julie</em>. Touring with the AMJ cast and crew has been the highlight of this young actress's career and she can't wait to join this talented bunch again. This year, Lindsey is taking a backseat from Hopegrown happenings as she is currently in the UK completing her Masters in Acting from the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. Although not directly involved, Lindsey is there in spirit and sending all her love to the <em class="lotus">LOTUS</em> team.</p>

				<p><strong>Caitlin Murphy</strong><br>Playwright for <em class="lotus">LOTUS</em></p>
				<p>Caitlin is a writer, director and dramaturg who has worked in both theatre and film. Most recently, her play <em>Fruits Unheard Of</em> was presented in New York City by Working Artists Theatre, and her piece <em>The Perfect Bird</em> was performed at the Centaur Theatre's <em>Urban Tales</em>.

				<p><strong>Bryan Doubt</strong><br>Director for <em class="lotus">LOTUS</em></p>
				<p>Bryan has taught actors and creative process for over twenty-five years at a number of reputable theatre schools and studios, including The Stratford Conservatory of Classical Theatre Training, the National Theatre School of Canada, the National Arts Centre, the Banff Centre and Concordia University. During that time he has developed an approach to training actors that emphasizes the integration of body, voice and text in performance and he remains very much in demand as a performance coach. "<em>The opportunity to direct a new play by Caitlin Murphy for Hopegrown Productions with two former and talented students, Miriam Cummings and Samantha Megarry, is a privilege. The subject of Caitlin's play, <em class="lotus">LOTUS</em>, matters. The issue of the internet and privacy underlines the potential danger of self-exposure when there are no boundaries. Loss of dignity, loss of control, loss of ourselves, these matter. Working with Caitlin's script and with actors Miriam and Samantha and the designer, Sonya Vallis, to uncover something about what it means to be human in cyberspace is what this production is about for me. The Montreal Fringe gives us the space to explore ways of creating meaningful roles for women in the theatre, which is one of Hopegrown's mandates. This is a young company to watch.</em>"</p>
