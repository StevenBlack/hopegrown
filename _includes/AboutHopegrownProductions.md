Hopegrown Productions is comprised of graduating Fine Arts students from Concordia University in Montreal, Canada. 

This project was initiated by theatre performance students who are keen to work together in order to bridge the gap between the academic and professional worlds. 

The only problem being: these three theatre students happen to be young women, and the number of plays featuring three young women, let alone three strong, dynamic, well-rounded women we have found to be woefully few and far between. 

As a group of multi-faceted artists, we have determined that in order to make the theatre we want to make, we must create artistic opportunities for ourselves. It was from this discovery that Hopegrown Productions was born.
