##Hopegrown Productions' Website


**[Hopegrown Productions](http://hopegrown.ca)** is a Montreal based theatre company, founded in Fall 2012 by graduating actors **Miriam Cummings**, **Lindsey Huebner** and **Samantha Megarry**. We are committed to staging interesting stories featuring dynamic female characters.

Our 2013 production, *Around Miss Julie*, was a new play by **[Harry Standjofski](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Standjofski)**.  It premiered at the **St-Ambroise Montreal Fringe Festival** and our summer tour continues through **Ottawa**, **London**, **Burlington**, **Hamilton** and beyond!
