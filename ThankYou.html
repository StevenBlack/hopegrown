<p>The cast and crew of <em>Around Miss Julie</em> have officially arrived in Edinburgh! 
	We are diving straight into all things Fringe. Our opening is on Sunday, and we will be spending 
	our time until then meeting other artists, performing on the Royal Mile, and promoting our show to anyone and everyone. 
	After a fantastic Canadian tour, we are thrilled (and a little terrified) to be here at the largest arts festival in the world. 
	It truly is much bigger than we could have imagined</p>

<p>So, <strong>THANK YOU</strong>.</p>
	
<p>Thank you for your support. Thank you for believing in us. <em>Around Miss Julie</em> could not be here without you. </p>

<p>Here are photos of our first day here at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe!</p>

<p><strong>YOU</strong> have made this possible - We are so grateful.</p>
