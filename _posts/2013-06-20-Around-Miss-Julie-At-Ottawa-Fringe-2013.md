Brought to you by Montréal’s Hopegrown Productions, Around Miss Julie tells the tale of a young theatre director and three actors adapting August Strindberg’s beloved classic while trying to deal with each other. Snowstorms, dead birds, and more await you in this dramedy penned by Harry Standjofski and directed by Norah Paton.

##ABOUT MISS JULIE (HOPEGROWN)

By: Harry Standjofski

*Around Miss Julie* takes a look at what happens to recent graduates, at the uncertainty of being in your early 20s, at the hilarious and sometimes manic process of putting on a play, and about the relationships that develop of destroy along the way.

The play leads us through auditions, rehearsals and opening night as a director and three actors struggle to put up Julie in a Snowstorm – a new adaptation of Strindberg’s classic. Throughout the process, the lines between rehearsal and reality are blurred as the cast tangle with the play, with each other… and a dead bird.

A brand new Canadian play featuring women’s stories—not men’s stories featuring women. “These don’t come around too often,” says director Norah Paton, “trust us, we looked.”
Hopegrown Productions commissioned Montréal theatre luminary Harry Standjofski to write the piece that will be the company’s debut, this summer in Ottawa, Montréal, Edinburgh, London ON, Hamilton, and Burlington.
