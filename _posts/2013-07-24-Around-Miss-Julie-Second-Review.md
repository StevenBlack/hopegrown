Review by: Katie Stoneman

Art imitating, life imitating art. Around Miss Julie is a must see if you like a show with laughs and lots of sexual tension; a pretty good mix of things.

It’s a play about putting on a play. Basically, it offers an inside joke for actors, thespians etc.

The play centers around three young actors, two female one male, one love triangle in the making. The trio of actors begin working on a play with Julie (Miriam Cummings) a clueless director who is certain she is the ‘Julie’ in August Strindberg’s 1888 naturalistic play Miss Julie.

As the three become increasingly close, and increasingly attracted to one another, the plot of the sordid love affairs in Stringberg’s play start to unfold in the three characters, Lyle (Mitchell Cohen), Donna (Lindsey Huebner ) and Illona (Samantha Megarry).

The actors that make up the ‘real life’ love triangle in this play keep the room fully charged with tension. It is pretty clear that they know, and have developed their characters well, knowing exactly how they would interact in these situations. They deliver witty and clever lines with great timing and anticipation.

The use of space in the Citadel Studio is fun and unique, much like most of what happens in this show. A mishmash of furniture is used to create the scenes as they’re happening. The use of the space, props paired with the tech work makes this play that much more intriguing. **The lighting in this play is probably among the most useful and tactful I’ve seen at this year’s Fringe**.

There’s plenty of great shows all over Hamilton. **This is one of them**. See it
