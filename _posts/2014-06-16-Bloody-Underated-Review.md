> **LOTUS**

> Hopegrown Productions, winners of last year’s Spirit of the FRINGE award here in Montreal, are back with a new piece: LOTUS.

> Born out of the stories of Amanda Todd and Rehteah Parsons, Caitlin Murphy has written this new play about “how one person’s suffering is never discrete” — a single event can create waves of pain throughout many lives. Rookie cop Linda is “investigating” teenager Amber for a disturbing photo that has been posted to her Facebook profile. During their meetings to try to uncover the story behind it, we get drawn into a world of objectification, abuse, and struggle. LOTUS is an engaging hour, weaving a tangled web that never lets you go. While some of the transitions felt long, this show features an incredibly timely and **tight script being played by two young actresses at the top of their game**.

> If you’re interested in one of the FRINGE’s better dramatic offerings, look no further! [For showtimes and tickets to this mature piece, click here](http://montrealfringe.ca/en/2014/lotus).
