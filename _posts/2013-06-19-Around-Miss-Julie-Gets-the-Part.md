<h2>Your Guide to FRINGE Fest 2013 </h2>
<p>By Alejandra Melian-Morse </p>

<p>With a mission to bring more dynamic female roles to the stage, <a href="http://thelinknewspaper.ca/article/4356">Hopegrown Productions</a> showed promise in the pre-fringe hype, even managing to making it onto The Main’s list of <a href="http://www.themainmtl.com/2013/06/10/fringe-festival-montreal-top-picks/" target="_blank">Top 10 Fringe Picks</a> .</p>

<p>The play by Harry Standjofski does not disappoint. The team is successful not only in the performance itself, but in achieving their much discussed mission. All four characters carry a complexity that is apparent on many different levels. Though dealing with issues of love and loss, the women of <em>Around Miss Julie</em> go much deeper, bringing out the harsh realities of finding one’s footing in the theatre world.</p>

<p>Even putting the unique female characters aside, the play is of immense quality. Based on August Strindberg’s Miss Julie, the script weaves its way in and out of the classic and mirrors the two plays seamlessly.</p>

<p>Delivered with seemingly effortless humour and energy, Around Miss Julie has its audience doubled over with laughter. With such a strong cast and a brilliant script, the play is definitely one worth seeing at the wonderfully intimate Club Español.</p>
