Based on the famous work by August Stringberg ‘*Around Miss Julie*’ takes an interesting and amusing take on the classic text. Focusing on the actors putting on a version of the play, this show is a must watch for any performer or director. Creating comedic moments from the perils of early rehearsal and ‘how they were going to ‘do’ the bird,’ ‘Around Miss Julie’ really finds its mark with hilarity and moments of poignance. Cleverly interlaced scenes leave audiences wondering where literature becomes reality and what happens when a the cast have a collective ‘intimate’ movement. **Rip roaringly funny and performed with consummate professionalism**, this show would be a brilliant addition to anyone’s Fringe schedule.

C nova, until 26 Aug, 5.30pm.

tw rating **4/5**  (Christie Rolley)
